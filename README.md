# Advanced-Networks-Project
Project for COMP3210: Advanced Networks module at Southampton.

This project involves the use of a server, a raspberry pi and a Nordic Thingy to create a service that a user can connect to for temperature information. 

TODO: install pi client on raspberry pi, perhaps add GPS information for pi, perhaps go slightly lower level with bluetooth stuff
